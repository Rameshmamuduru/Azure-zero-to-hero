Ramesh, listing **every single Azure service individually** would be extremely long (Azure has 200+ services and keeps adding new ones).

Instead, I’ll give you a **complete category-wise structured list** of services available in **Microsoft Azure** — this is how Microsoft itself organizes them.

If you want, I can:

* 📌 Give AWS vs Azure service mapping
* 📌 Give most important services for DevOps interviews
* 📌 Make a roadmap of what you should learn first

Since you're preparing seriously, I recommend learning in this order:
Compute → Networking → Storage → AKS → Monitoring → Security.

Tell me what you want next 👌
